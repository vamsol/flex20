This package is responsible for maintaining the documentation for the project template, and is the source code for this live site.

---

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), in hopes of building better organized documentation around what the Flex Project Template is, how to get started and build with it, and provide a starting point for customers to document their functionality.

The live documentation site can be found [here](https://twilio-professional-services.github.io/flex-project-template/), but can also be run locally by executing the following at the root directory of the template (after running `npm i` in the `/docs` folder):

```
npm run start:docs
```
