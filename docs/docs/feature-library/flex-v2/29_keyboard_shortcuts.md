# Setup and dependencies

This plugin only supports Twilio Flex 2.1 and above because support for keyboard shortcuts has been introduced with Flex 2.1.

Other than that, there are no other specific dependencies or setup steps required.

# How does it work?

With the release of Flex 2.1, Flex now supports keyboards shortcuts for the most common actions performed by agents. The official documentation can be found [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/end-user-guide/keyboard-shortcuts).

The 2.1 Flex UI exposes various APIs to interact with the default keyboard shortcuts, as well as adding custom ones. The official documentation can be found [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/modify-keyboard-shortcuts).

### How are you persisting changes between refreshes?

User modification to both default and custom keyboard shortcuts are stored into browser local storage and read during plugin initialization.

### Default keyboard shortcuts

Twilio Flex comes with a list of default shortcuts which can be found [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/end-user-guide/keyboard-shortcuts).

### Custom keyboard shortcuts

With the help of new Flex APIs, it is possible to add custom shortcuts like described [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/modify-keyboard-shortcuts#add-custom-shortcuts). The following list of custom shortcuts are all custom values preconfigured as a part of this [plugin](https://github.com/twilio-professional-services/flex-project-template/blob/main/plugin-flex-ts-template-v2/src/feature-library/keyboard-shortcuts/utils/CustomKeyboardShortcuts.ts).
